    /** Network:
            This object is the entry point to libquic, providing functionalities like job scheduling and endpoint creation
        for application implementation. Networks can have one of two relationships to event loop that it manages:
            - Standard ownership: The event loop's lifetime is entirely managed within the Network object. It is not a
                publicly exposed attribute, and cannot be accessed to directly construct other networks "chained" off of the
                same event loop. If the application requires multiple networks that share one underlying event loop, invoking
                the `::create_linked_network()` method will return a new Network object sharing its own event loop. For the
                application code, this has the effect of only destroying the event loop when the last Network sharing it is
                destroyed.
            - Application ownership: The event loop's lifetime is entirely managed by the application code and managing
                context. A standalone Loop object is created and passed by value in each subsequent Network construction. It
                is the responsibility of the application code to ensure that the event loop is last to be destroyed. Objects
                like endpoints are held in shared_pointers with deleters scheduled on the event loop. The event loop must
                persist until all objects held externally (Network, Endpoint, Connection, etc) are destroyed.
